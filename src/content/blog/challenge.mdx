# The 100 Days Grind

The 100 days Grind, is a personal challenge i designed to maximize productivity and personal growth. Each day is scheduled to get the most out of it and out of my self. This includes waking up between 5 and 5:15 everyday, making the bed, meditation, resistance training, studying, work and cardiovascular exercise, ending with an evening meditation, all this supported by a nutritious diet. This is everyday, no rests, no excuses.

To be able to complete this challenge, first i had to fix my sleeping habits so, in orther to do that i adopted an unconventional approach. It is known that for optimal sleep reducing all sources of lights two hours before bedtime is benefitial, even better, watching the last light of the day when the sun is setting can help stablish your circadian rythm, this being the natural 24-hour cycles of physical, mental, and behavioral changes that occur in the body. They are controlled by a biological clock in the brain and are mainly affected by light and darkness. To support this i decided to use only the light of the day, and when the darkness starts to set and it's time to cook the last meal of the day, i light a candle. Reciving the light source of the candle from below your line of sight and not from above helps in getting a robust circadian rythm and to get ready for a good night sleep. I had troubles to sleep for about two years, today is day 70/100 using this method, and i slept like a baby every single night.

## Benefits

Today being the 70th day, i can confirm that there are no detriments in this routine, my mind is sharp, my body is stronger than ever and the bond and confidence between me and myself seems to grow everyday. We all know that voice that tells you, 'Its ok, you can stay in bed for a little longer' or, 'Take a break today, you deserve it'. Learning to silence that voice that tells you to avoid what's good and necessary for you, will develop a tremendous confidence and self discipline. When you realize that there's no more doubt that you will face whatever you have to face today and tomorrow, your mind will be strong enough and ready for more. The never ending journey of self development.

In embracing the effort and the uncomfortable i found peace of mind.
