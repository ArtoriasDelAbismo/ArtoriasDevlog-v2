# What am i doing?

The reason i started this blog post is because i found myself in a status quo regarding my studies and personal projects, and im feeling a little lost. This happens frecuently and writing things down is usually a good way to organize my thoughts and find the way again in the end.<br/> I recently started a course about Python, and so far is going well. I thought i needed to start dipping my toes into the world of Machine Learning, and the best way to begin was from the basicsâ€”with Python, a language I didnâ€™t know much about aside from the fact that functions are defined by the reserved word **def**. Whats up with that by the way? But i cant help wondering if im in the right path, Is it really necessary to take on a heavy 9-hour course that demands significant mental energy right now? Do I think my knowledge of JavaScript is solid enough to start learning another language? Well, not really, to be honest. In fact, I think it's still pretty basic. <br/>
Ok, first clue, may be i should

- Focus in solidify my JS and React knowledge <br/>

I came back from the gym and made breakfast, meat with eggs, i need to add more protein to my diet. There's a problem with this, i just finished breakfast and it's 9:22 am, meaning i could work/study for about an hour before i have to get ready to go to work if that day im using the bus. Hour and a half if im using my motorcicle, and im not considering the time that takes to make my lunch, so may be i could <br/>

- Work on my schedule and stablish a limit for workout so i have more time to cook and then study
- Make breakfast and lunch at the same time genius

I like going to the gym at first hour in the morning, this is at 7, i enjoy the benefits of starting my day working out in a fasted state, but the problem with this is that i have to go to the gym and then return, wasting valuable time. May be it's better to

- work/study/cook from 5:15 to 10 and then go to the gym and straight to work once i finish my routine.

This was a method that has been proved usefull and productive in the recent past so may be i should consider going back to it.

A day has passed thinking about this, and it occured me that it might be benefitial to keep learning Python, not only to begin with machine learning, but to learn how to generate scripts to automate different tasks that would make my job easier. <br/>

Ok, i think i got it. I will continue the Python course utilizing the day format `work/study/cook from 5:15 to 10 and then go to the gym and straight to work once i finish my routine.` for a week and let`s see what happens.

Let`s get to work.
