# Hell is Us: A Different Take on Semi Open-World Games

How refreshing it is to see a clean HUD for a change? No quest pointers, no map overflowing with markers, just you, your instincts, and the world around you. When I saw the first gameplay of Hell is Us, I was pleasantly surprised by how immersive it seemed. In a time where open-world games are often criticized for being vast but lacking meaningful content, Hell is Us offers a promising alternative: a semi-open world crafted with care, attention to detail, and patience.

[Hell is Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620730/Hell_is_Us/) is an upcoming 3rd-person action-adventure game set to release some time in 2025 and developed by Rogue Factor, with a focus on exploration and melee combat. The game’s narrative follows Remi, a man returning to his birthplace, Hadea—a country isolated from the world and ravaged by civil war. In this dark, fictional world, Remi searches for answers about his past, confronting both the terrors of war and supernatural forces that haunt his homeland.

Even though the developers have stated that it’s not a souls-like game, Hell is Us gives off a similar vibe. Watching the gameplay i could sense a blend of Jedi: Fallen Order’s sci-fi elements with the bleak atmosphere and combat style reminiscent of a Dark Souls game. The lack of hand-holding combined with a focus on exploration adds to its charm. But that`s just my appretiation on a very short gameplay. I definetly want to see more of this world and lore.

I have high hopes for this one. It’s definitely a title I’ll be keeping a close eye on. With its unique approach to storytelling and gameplay, Hell is Us could be a breath of fresh air in an increasingly crowded genre. Stay tuned for updates, because this is a game you won’t want to miss!
