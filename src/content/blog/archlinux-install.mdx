description: A no nonsense guide to installing Arch Linux
---

In my journey through the digital world, I realized that so many things are waiting to be learned, experienced, and enjoyed that I couldn't stick to just one method or workflow. That's when the Linux itch began.

I first tried Ubuntu, known for being beginner-friendly, and later explored Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)—a Microsoft Windows feature that allows you to use a Linux environment without needing a virtual machine or dual boot. I still use WSL to this day. However, after three years and a conversation with a friend who was installing Arch Linux at the time, that old itch for distro-hopping resurfaced.

So today, dear reader, we’re diving into Arch Linux. Let’s install it together!

## Preparation

This guide assumes you already have a bootable USB drive with the Arch ISO image. We’ll perform a UEFI installation, so ensure your system supports this modern boot mode.

We’ll be using Archinstall—a helpful tool despite the skepticism of traditional Arch users. While it simplifies the process, it’s a good idea to read through the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) to understand the underlying mechanics, as Arch Linux embodies a do-it-yourself philosophy.

We’ll cover manual installation in a future post.

## Step 1: Boot from USB

- Access your BIOS and set the boot priority to USB.

- Insert the flash drive, save your BIOS settings, and exit.

- You should now see the following screen:

	alt='Boot screen'
/>
Select the first option and press Enter.

- For better readability, increase the font size by typing:

```bash
setfont ter-132b
```

## Step 2: Connect to the Internet

A stable internet connection is essential. If using Ethernet, simply plug in the cable. For Wi-Fi, follow these steps using iwctl:

1. Launch the iwctl tool:

```bash
iwctl
```

2. List all devices:

```bash
device list
```

3. Locate your Wi-Fi device and check it's details:

```bash
device wlan0 show
```

4. List available networks:

```bash
station wlan0 get-networks
```

5. Connect to your network

```bash
station wlan0 connect WIFI_NAME
```

6. Enter your Wi-Fi password and wait a few seconds. Exit iwctl:

```bash
exit
```

7. Test the connection:

```bash
ping google.com
```

## Step 3: Disk Formatting

1. Sync packages repositories:

```bash
pacman -Sy
```

2. Identify connected drives:

```bash
lsblk
```

3. For detailed drive information

```bash
fdisk -l
```

4. Erease the target drived:

```bash
gdisk /dev/disk_to_be_ereased
```

- Press **x** to enter expert mode
- Press **z** to erease the drive.

5. Verify the disk is clean using **lsblk**

6. Update keyring to ensure package authenticity:

```bash
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
```

## Step 4: Install Arch Linux with Archinstall

1.  Install Archinstall:

```bash
pacman -Sy archinstall
```

2.  Launch the installer

```bash
archinstall
```

3. Configure the installation by following the options on the screen:
